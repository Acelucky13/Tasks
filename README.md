Submitted by: **Miguel Gomez**

**Tasks** is an app that an app made for everyday life to remind you of things needed to do-
and daily tasks, via take the trash out, etc ...

Time spent: **120** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] App displays a list of tasks
- [ ] Users can add tasks to the list
- [ ] Session persists when application is closed and relaunched (tasks dont get deleted when closing app) 
  - [ ] Note: You have to quit the app, not minimize it, in order to see the persistence.
- [ ] Tasks can be deleted
- [ ] Users have a calendar view via navigation controller that displays tasks	


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Tasks can be toggled completed
- [ ] User can edit tasks by tapping on the task in the feed view
- [ ] User can can quit app and restart it and the app will continue again to the same tasks left.

The challenges I met were to find a solution to integrate Calender,and task at the end of project-
but I was able to finish the app completely.
